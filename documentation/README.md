# Notes
* Using an API without reading documentation could lead to wasted time and mental energy. 
* Granted that you could figure out the API knowing the System, but the API documentation could contain tips/tricks, caveats that one might not realize from using the API out of the box (without consulting documentation).
* Great APIs, Programming systems are always packaged with excellent documetnation. By not reading the supplied documentation, the programmer is committing a foolish mistake.
